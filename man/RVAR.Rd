\description{
Estimate a regime-dependent VAR (i.e. a state-dependent VAR), with an exogenous state indicator, of the specification:
\deqn{Y_{t+1} = X_t \beta_{s_t} + \epsilon_t}
where \emph{t} is the time index, \emph{Y} is the set of outcome vectors, \emph{X} the design matrix (of \emph{p} lagged values of Y), and
\emph{s} is a mutually exclusive state of the world observed at time \emph{t}. When the regime vector is not supplied by the user, then a two-state
regime series is estimated via random forest.
}
\details{
The regime-dependent VAR is a generalization of the popular threshold VAR - which trades off estimating a threshold value for an
endogenous variable for accepting an exogenous regime that can be based on information from inside or outside of the system, with or without parametric
assumptions, and with or without timing restrictions. Moreover, the RVAR may be extended to include structural shocks, including the use of instrumental
variables.

\strong{State dependence.} The RVAR augments the traditional VAR by allowing state-dependence in the coefficient matrix. The RVAR differs from the more common threshold VAR (TVAR), due
to the fact that states are exegonesouly determined. As a result, the states (i.e. regimes) do not need to be based on information inside the model, moreover, regimes can be
determined by any process the user determines best fits their needs. For example, regimes based on NBER dated recessions and expansions are based on a judgmental process
considering hundreds of series, potentially none of which are in the VAR being modeled. Alternatively, a user may use unsupervised machine learning to assign regimes - this is
the process the \code{sovereign::regimes} function facilitates.

\strong{Structural shocks.} See Sims (1980) for details regarding the baseline vector-autoregression (VAR) model. The VAR may be augmented to become a structural VAR (SVAR) with one of three different structural identification strategies:
\enumerate{
\item short-term impact restrictions via Cholesky decomposition, see Christiano et al (1999) for details \strong{(structure = 'short')}
\item external instrument identification, i.e. a Proxy-SVAR strategy, see Mertens and Ravn (2013) for details \strong{(structure = 'IV')}
\item or a combination of short-term and IV identification via Lunsford (2015) \strong{(structure = 'IV-short')}
}

Note that including structure does not change the estimation of model coefficients or forecasts, but does change impulse response functions, forecast error variance decomposition,
and historical decompositions. Historical decompositions will not be available for models using the 'IV' structure. Additionally note that only one instrument may be used in this
estimation routine.
